# Devcontainer template `typo3`

Homepage: [Github](https://github.com/thucke/devcontainer-templates/tree/main/src/typo3)

>[!CAUTION] Caution Windows WSL Users
>If you want to develop locally on your Windows machine the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is always involved. It's a well known limitation in WSL that cross platform performance (Windows Host->WSL / WSL->Windows Host) is very sluggish which could cause timeouts e.g. during composer install.
>The reason is that behind the scenes your local git directory is mounted into the running devcontainer which will find yourself and your project immediately facing the upper mentioned issue.
>
>As a workaround you should checkout your Git repository into a WSL guest and launch the Development Container from there. The internal mount then is within the same platform WSL internal.
>
>Other alternatives would be doing *real* remote development like among others [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [Coder](https://coder.com/), [Devpod](https://devpod.sh/), [Ona (former Gitpod)](https://ona.com/). Usually your repository is directly checked out into the Devcontainer.

## Working in the TYPO3 Devcontainer

  After the TYPO3 devcontainer environment came up you will find in a container running Debian Trixie:

* User: `typo3dev`
* Homedirectory: `/home/typo3dev`
* SUDO-command: *passwordless for any command*
* Git-Repository: checked out to `${WORKSPACE_ROOT}`

## TYPO3 WebUI

URL: [Frontend](http://127.0.0.1)

First calls to TYPO3 my result to exceptions in the file `.build/vendor/scssphp/scssphp/src/Compiler.php`. I don't have an idea about the reason but they will disappear after one or two refreshes.

## Re-Initialize TYPO3 environment

  If you need to get a clean TYPO3 environment based upon your configuration you may spawn a terminal window and execute

   `${WORKSPACE_ROOT}/.devcontainer/docker/igniteEnvironment.sh`

## Update devcontainer template

If you want to update the devcontainer configuration e.g. after a new template version has been published or you want to switch a component you can make use of the [Dev Container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) with the following command (**make sure you're in the root directory of your repository**):

    devcontainer templates apply --template-id ghcr.io/thucke/devcontainer-templates/typo3  --template-args "{\"database\": \"mysql\", \"phpVersion\": \"8.4\", \"webserver\": \"frankenphp\"}" -w .

Valid values:

* `database`: `mysql` || `mariadb` ||`sqlite` || `postgresql`
* `phpVersion`: `8.2` || `8.3` || `8.4` || `8.5`
* `webserver`: `frankenphp` || `apache` || `nginx`

The default configuration consists of:

* `database`: `mysql`
* `phpVersion`: `8.4`
* `webserver`: `frankenphp`

## TYPO3 environment configuration

  You may modify the file `${WORKSPACE_ROOT}/.devcontainer/.env` with caution if you want to adjust some core TYPO3 settings. After this file has been modified it is recommended to rebuild the whole devcontainer.

  **In this file you can find the password of the database root as well as the TYPO3 backend user credentials.**

## Database connection (Default settings)
